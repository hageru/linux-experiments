# linux-experiments
This repository is made for my linux experiments about memory, disk, cpu, and so on.  
I have made this repository to verify behavior of linux, for example difference between any distoribution.
I think some libc library's functions and some commands (free, top, cat /proc/meminfo, and so on) are different by distoribution, version, and so on.

Please use it if you like.
